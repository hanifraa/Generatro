            About this website
        </h3>
        <p>Ayo, this is a random number generator website called Generatro. Generatro will help you to have a random number between 1 to 100. <br>
            This website is made for people who wants to pick a number but are too stressed to do so. And also to fulfill my Web Programming assignment. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Philosophy of the name
        </h3>
        <p>
            Generatro is made up with two words, generator and retro. Generator u kno la, and retro is the theme of this website even though it is not really retro. <br>
            But, I like how it sounds, so I call it Generatro.
        </p>
